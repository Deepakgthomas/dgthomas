## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Tulane University. I am interested in working on problems related to Deep Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, and Bayesian Networks. I obtained a Master's in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University.
